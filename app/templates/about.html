        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>TTracker3 is the 3<sup>rd</sup> revision of my ticket tracking web application, and this is intended to be the final version. The first two iterations were written in PHP. After learning about Flask, I decided to rewrite the system. I've included new features and I think the project as a whole runs better and is more secure than any of the previous iterations. Integrating Bootstrap also makes it much better looking than any of the other iterations.</p>
        <br />
        <h2>How was this made?</h2>
        <p>TTracker3 was written using CSS, HTML, and Python 3.4. The following frameworks made this possible:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a></li>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy">Flask-SQLAlchemy</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf">Flask-WTF</a></li>
            </ul>
            <li><a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a></li>
        </ul>
