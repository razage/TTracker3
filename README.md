TTracker3
=========
This project has gone through many iterations, but this should be the definitive version at last. The idea of this project is to provide my computer repair class a convenient way to track repairs that have been done. It also allows users to search for problems and see how others tackled them.

Requirements
============
* Python 3.X
  * Flask
  * Flask-SQLAlchemy
  * Flask-WTF
