# TTracker3
TicketTracker3 (TTracker3 for short) is the third and (hopefully) final revision of my ticketing system. Previous versions have been written in PHP, but I decided to write this one using the Flask framework. The system was made for my computer repair class to keep track of repairs done and assist my professor with grading.

## Requirements
* Python 3.x (2.7 might work; I haven't tested that.)
    * Flask
    * Flask-SQLAlchemy
    * Flask-WTForms
